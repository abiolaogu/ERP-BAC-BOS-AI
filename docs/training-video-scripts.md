"Welcome to NEXUS, the Business Operating System by Business Activation Cloud. NEXUS is an AI-first platform that gives you everything you need to run your business, all in one place.

CRM for managing customers. Finance tools for invoicing and payments. Project management for your teams. A full office suite with email, file storage, document editing, chat, and video meetings. And an AI copilot that understands your business data and helps you work smarter.

That is NEXUS. No more juggling fifteen different software subscriptions. No more copying data between tools. No more six-month setup processes. Just one platform, one login, and AI-powered intelligence across everything.

NEXUS supports businesses globally, with native integration for African payment systems like Paystack and Flutterwave, alongside international providers like Stripe. Communication channels include WhatsApp, SMS, and email, all connected to your business data.

### Video A2: "Navigating the NEXUS Dashboard"
**Duration**: 8 minutes
**Visual**: Screen recording of the NEXUS web console

**Script**:

[Screen recording begins at the login page]

"After logging in, you arrive at the NEXUS dashboard. Let me walk you through what you see.

At the top, you have the global search bar. Press Control-K, or Command-K on Mac, to open it from anywhere. Search for contacts, invoices, tasks, documents -- anything in the system.

To the right of the search bar, you will find the notifications bell showing your unread alerts, and your profile avatar for accessing settings.

On the left side is the main navigation sidebar. The modules available depend on what your administrator has enabled for your organization. Common modules include:

[Click through each module as mentioned]

Home -- your dashboard with activity feed, calendar widget, and quick actions.
CRM -- contacts, leads, opportunities, and your sales pipeline.
Finance -- invoices, payments, and financial reports.
Projects -- tasks, Kanban boards, Gantt charts, and milestones.
HR -- employee directory, leave requests, and attendance.
Inventory -- products, stock levels, and warehouse management.
Office -- this expands to show Mail, Drive, Writer, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Chat, and Meet.

At the bottom right corner, you will always find the AI Copilot button. Click it or press Control-slash to open the AI assistant, which can help you with any task or answer questions about your data.

Let me show you the dashboard widgets. Here you can see your recent activity, upcoming calendar events, and quick action buttons for creating new contacts, tasks, or invoices. These widgets are customizable -- click the settings gear to arrange them to your preference.

That is the NEXUS dashboard. Every feature is just one or two clicks away."

### Video A3: "Understanding Your AI Copilot"
**Duration**: 8 minutes
**Visual**: Screen recording showing AI Copilot interactions

**Script**:

[Screen recording with the AI Copilot panel open]

"The AI Copilot is one of the most powerful features of NEXUS. It understands your business data and can help you with tasks across every module. Let me show you what it can do.

[Click the AI icon]

I will type: 'Show me all contacts tagged as VIP that were added this month.'

[AI processes and returns results]

The AI Copilot queried your CRM data and returned exactly what I asked for. Notice it shows the contact names, emails, and when they were added. I can follow up with: 'Draft a thank-you email to each of them.'

[AI generates email drafts]

The AI uses context from your data to personalize each email. I can review, edit, and send these directly.

Let me show another example. I will ask: 'What is our revenue trend for the last three months?'

[AI queries finance data and presents a summary]

It pulled data from the Finance module and gave me a clear summary with numbers. I could ask it to create a chart, generate a report, or compare against a previous period.

The AI Copilot works across all modules. You can ask about project status, employee leave balances, inventory levels, or support ticket trends. It respects your permission level, so you only see data you have access to.

Tips for getting the best results: Be specific in your requests. Mention dates, names, or filters when relevant. Use follow-up questions to dig deeper -- the AI remembers your conversation context within a session.

The AI Copilot is always available at the bottom right of your screen, ready to help."

## 3. Series B: End User Training

### Video B1: "CRM Mastery -- Contacts and Leads"
**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Visual**: Screen recording of CRM module

**Script**:

"In this video, you will learn to manage contacts and leads effectively in the NEXUS CRM.

[Navigate to CRM > Contacts]

Let us start by creating a contact. Click the plus button here. Fill in the essential fields: first name, last name, email, and phone. You can also add a company, job title, and tags. Tags are powerful for organizing contacts -- use them for categories like 'VIP', 'Lead Source: Website', or 'Industry: Healthcare'.

[Create a sample contact]

Now let us look at leads. Leads are potential customers who have shown interest but have not yet been qualified. Navigate to CRM, then Leads.

[Navigate to Leads]

I will create a new lead. Enter the contact information and the lead source -- this could be Website, Referral, Trade Show, or Cold Outreach.

The lead lifecycle works like this: You create the lead as New. After your first interaction, update it to Contacted. Once you have confirmed budget, authority, need, and timeline, mark it as Qualified. If the lead is not a fit, mark it as Unqualified.

[Demonstrate status changes]

When a lead is qualified and ready for a deal discussion, click the Convert button. This creates an Opportunity with the lead's information pre-filled, and the lead record is preserved for your history.

[Convert the lead]

Finally, let me show you search and filtering. Click the filter icon to combine criteria. I can filter by tag, date range, lead source, and status. Save this combination as a view for one-click access in the future.

[Demonstrate filtering and saving a view]

That is CRM contact and lead management in NEXUS."

### Video B2: "Creating and Managing Invoices"
**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Visual**: Screen recording of Finance module

**Script**:

"Let us walk through creating and managing invoices in NEXUS.

[Navigate to Finance > Invoices]

Click New Invoice to start. First, select or create the customer. If the customer is already in your CRM, just start typing their name and select from the dropdown.

[Select a customer]

Now add line items. Click Add Item, enter a description, quantity, and unit price. The total calculates automatically. You can add as many line items as needed.

[Add 3 line items]

Set the tax rate if applicable, and add any discount. Choose the payment terms -- Net 15, Net 30, or a custom due date.

[Configure payment terms]

Preview the invoice to see how it looks. The invoice uses your organization's branding -- logo, colors, and contact information.

[Show preview]

When ready, click Send. The customer receives an email with a payment link. They can pay directly via Stripe, Paystack, or Flutterwave, depending on your configured gateway.

[Send the invoice]

Back on the invoices list, you can track status. Green means paid. Yellow means sent and waiting. Red means overdue. Click any invoice to view details, record manual payments, or send reminders.

[Show invoice list with status indicators]

For reporting, navigate to Finance, then Reports. The Revenue Summary shows your income over time. Accounts Receivable shows who owes you money. Payment History shows all completed transactions.

[Show reports briefly]

That is invoicing in NEXUS -- create, send, track, and get paid."

### Video B3: "Office Suite -- Email, Drive, and Documents"
**Duration**: 12 minutes

**Script**:

"The NEXUS Office Suite gives your team professional-grade productivity tools built right into the platform. Let me show you Mail, Drive, and Writer.

[Navigate to Office > Mail]

Your NEXUS email works just like any professional email client. Compose a new email, add recipients, write your message with rich formatting, and attach files. You can attach files directly from NEXUS Drive, which keeps everything connected.

[Compose and send an email]

Your inbox supports folders, labels, and powerful search. Set up filters to automatically sort incoming mail.

[Navigate to Office > Drive]

Drive is your file storage. Upload files by dragging them into the browser window. Create folders for organization. Right-click any file to share it -- you can give View, Comment, or Edit access to specific team members or the entire organization.

Every file has version history. If someone edits a file, you can see previous versions and restore if needed.

[Navigate to Office > Writer]

Writer is our collaborative document editor. Create a new document, and you get a full word processor with formatting, tables, images, and more.

The real power is collaboration. Click Share and invite a colleague. You will both see each other's cursors and edits in real-time. No more emailing documents back and forth.

When finished, export to PDF, DOCX, or HTML with one click.

[Demonstrate real-time collaboration]

These tools work together seamlessly. Write a proposal in Writer, store it in Drive, and email it to a client through Mail. Everything stays connected within NEXUS."
