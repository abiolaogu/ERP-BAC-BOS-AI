- Company size: 25-250 employees
- Industry: Tech, healthcare, finance, manufacturing
- Budget: $5,000+/month on SaaS
- Pain: High SaaS costs, integration issues

- Budget: $2,000+/month on SaaS
- Pain: SaaS sprawl
- Tech-savvy: Moderate

### Qualification (BANT)

**Budget**: Do they spend $5,000+/month on SaaS?
**Authority**: Are we talking to economic buyer (CTO, CEO, COO)?
**Need**: Do they have pain we solve (cost, integration, data sovereignty)?
**Timeline**: Can they buy in next 90 days?

### Discovery Questions

1. "How many SaaS tools do you currently use?"
2. "What's your total monthly spend on software?"
3. "What are your biggest pain points with your current stack?"
4. "Have you considered consolidating to a single platform?"
5. "What's important to you: cost savings, integration, data ownership?"
6. "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
7. "What does your evaluation process look like?"
8. "What would prevent you from moving forward?"

### Demo Structure (45 min)

1. **Intro** (5 min): Set agenda, understand goals
2. **Current State** (5 min): Their pain points, current tools
3. **Demo** (25 min):

### Objection Handling

**"We're happy with Microsoft/Google"**

**"We're concerned about switching costs"**
→ "We offer free migration (Enterprise+), and our customers are typically live in under 2 weeks. Plus, with $10K/month in savings, ROI is immediate."

**"Is it really production-ready?"**
→ "Yes – we have 500+ customers, 99.99% uptime SLA, and are SOC 2 certified. Let me show you our architecture and customer references."

**"What about support?"**
→ "All plans include 24/7 support, and Enterprise+ gets dedicated account manager. Plus, since it's self-hosted, your team has full control."

**"We need [specific feature]"**
