---

## Slide 4: How We Keep Your Costs Low

### Our Secret: Vertical Integration

**Traditional SaaS Companies:**
```
YOU PAY → AI Platform (40% margin)
            ↓
          Twilio (35% margin)
            ↓
          AWS (30% margin)
            ↓
          Actual infrastructure cost

Your $100 becomes $35 of actual infrastructure
```

**BAC on YOUR COMPANY Infrastructure:**
```
YOU PAY → BAC Platform
            ↓
          OUR voice platform (we own it)
          OUR databases (we own it)
          OUR infrastructure (we own it)
            ↓
          Actual infrastructure cost

Your $100 becomes $60 of actual infrastructure
```

**Result: We can charge you 60-75% less** while still making a healthy margin.

**This Is Why:**
- Our voice costs are $0.002/min (Twilio charges you $0.014/min)
- Our compute costs are $0.03/vCPU-hour (AWS charges you $0.15)
- Our database costs are $0.08/GB (Snowflake charges you $0.40)

**We pass these savings directly to you.**
